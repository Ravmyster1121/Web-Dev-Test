            <h3 class="about">Special Features:</h3>
            <p class="about">
                I have implemented a dynamic navigation bar located at the top of each page. 
                It is able to show what page you are currently on and the color changes when 
                you are hovering over a link to a different site
            </p>

            <h3 class="about">Difficulties:</h3>
            <p class="about">
                The thing that i had the most trouble with was getting the search function,
                I spent alot of time figuring out how to write the correct SQL query
                and then display the rows in the table that were returned.
            </p>

            <h3 class="about">Improvements for next time:</h3>
            <p class="about">
                Next time I would add scaling for the website so that the layout is dynamic and 
                all the content will displayed correctly on a phone screen.
            </p>

            <p class="about">
                Prior to this course I had no experince with PHP, and I was not very confident with mySQL and working with databases.<br>
                This assignment gave me an opportunity to upskill with PHP and increased my confidence when working with databases.<br>
